# Advent of Code 2021 (Stars so far: 6/50)

In the words of its creator Eric Wastl:

*"<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."*

Keeping it simple this yearâ€”no YouTube videos, and I won't be recording the time it took me to complete each answer, so I'll just post my official time and rank for each puzzle below.
